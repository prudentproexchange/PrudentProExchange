          <ul class="features-list">
            <li>Intrinsic Value: Gold’s inherent worth as a physical asset underpins the value of gold-backed currencies, ensuring your wealth is anchored by a real, enduring resource.</li>
            <li>Price Stability: Gold-backed currencies maintain long-term purchasing power, resisting the volatility and inflationary pressures that erode fiat currencies.</li>

            <li>Inflation Protection: As fiat currencies falter under inflation, gold-backed currencies hold firm, preserving wealth through their stable, gold-tied value.</li>
            <li>Global Acceptance: Gold’s universal recognition makes gold-backed currencies ideal for international markets, enhancing their strategic value in a connected world.</li>
