          <p class="section-text">
            Gold-backed currencies, directly tied to the intrinsic value of gold, provide a robust shield against economic turbulence. By linking currency to a tangible, finite asset, these systems ensure stability and trust. Here’s why they are a cornerstone of wealth management:
          </p>
          <ul class="features-list">
            <li><strong>Intrinsic Value:</strong> Gold’s inherent worth as a physical asset underpins the value of gold-backed currencies, ensuring your wealth is anchored by a real, enduring resource.</li>
            <li><strong>Price Stability:</strong> Gold-backed currencies maintain long-term purchasing power, resisting the volatility and inflationary pressures that erode fiat currencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical Trust:</strong> For centuries, gold has been a universal symbol of reliability, a legacy that gold-backed currencies carry forward, fostering confidence among investors worldwide.</li>
            <li><strong>Inflation Protection:</strong> As fiat currencies falter under inflation, gold-backed currencies hold firm, preserving wealth through their stable, gold-tied value.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Acceptance:</strong> Gold’s universal recognition makes gold-backed currencies ideal for international markets, enhancing their strategic value in a connected world.</li>
