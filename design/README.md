### Instructions for Using the README.md
1. **Create the File**:
   - In your GitHub repository's root directory, create a file named `README.md`.
   - Copy and paste the content above into the file.

2. **Customize Placeholders**:
   - Replace `https://github.com/your-username/prudentproexchange` with your actual repository URL.
   - Update the repository name if it‚Äôs not `prudentproexchange`.
   - If you have a specific license file, link to it in the License section. If not, create a `LICENSE` file or remove the link.
   - Add any additional contact information if needed.

3. **Commit and Push**:
   - Save the file and commit it to your repository:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README.md"
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Verify on GitHub**:
   - Visit your repository on GitHub to ensure the `README.md` renders correctly. It will appear on the main page of your repo.
